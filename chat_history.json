    "content": "The process of applying for a patent in India involves several steps:\n\n1. Filing: File an application with a national patent Office or directly with the International Bureau (IB) of WIPO, complying with the PCT formality requirements and fees. In India, PCT applications are filed at appropriate patent offices decided on the basis of territorial limits.\n\n2. Examination: After the application is filed, the Patent office examines it and issues an examination report to the applicant, known as the First Examination Report (FER).\n\n3. Compliance: The applicant is required to comply with the requirements within a period of 6 months from the date of FER, which can be extended by 3 months.\n\n4. Grant: If the application is found to be in order for grant, the patent is granted, provided there is no pre-grant opposition filed or pending. A letter patent is issued to the applicant.\n\nIn the case of international patent applications, the process includes an additional step:\n\n5. National Phase: After the end of the international PCT procedure, usually at 30/31 months from the earliest filing date of your initial application, from which you claim priority, you start to pursue the grant of your patents directly before the national (or regional) patent Offices of the countries in which you want to obtain them.\n\nSource: Office of CGP DTM, INDIA | www.ipindia.gov.in Page 19 Frequently Asked Questions 2020\n\nSource: D:\\BuzzBoard_Assessment\\BB_assessment\\data\\Final_FREQUENTLY_ASKED_QUESTIONS_-PATENT.pdf",
